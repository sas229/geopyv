abstract = {Some reported analyses of images of deforming granular materials have generated surprising vermiculate strain features which are difficult to reconcile with the mechanics of deformation of granular matter. Detailed investigation using synthetic images and improved processing of images of laboratory experiments indicates that such features can emerge as a consequence of the image acquisition (sensor, contrast, resolution), the subsequent image correlation implementation, and the user’s choice of processing parameters. The two principal factors are: (i) the texture and resolution of the images and (ii) the algorithm used to achieve sub-pixel displacement resolution. Analysis of the images using a sub-pixel interpolation algorithm that is more robust than that used originally eliminates the vermiculate features for images with moderate resolution and texture. However, erroneous features persist in images with low resolution and poor texture. Guidance is provided on ways in which such artefacts can be avoided through improved experimental and image analysis techniques.}

abstract = {In digital image correlation (DIC), to obtain the displacements of each point of interest, a correlation criterion must be predefined to evaluate the similarity between the reference subset and the target subset. The correlation criterion is of fundamental importance in DIC, and various correlation criteria have been designed and used in literature. However, little research has been carried out to investigate their relations. In this paper, we first provide a comprehensive overview of various correlation criteria used in DIC. Then we focus on three robust and most widely used correlation criteria, i.e., a zero-mean normalized cross-correlation (ZNCC) criterion, a zero-mean normalized sum of squared difference (ZNSSD) criterion, and a parametric sum of squared difference (PSSDab) criterion with two additional unknown parameters, since they are insensitive to the scale and offset changes of the target subset intensity and have been highly recommended for practical use in literature. The three correlation criteria are analyzed to establish their transversal relationships, and the theoretical analyses clearly indicate that the three correlation criteria are actually equivalent, which elegantly unifies these correlation criteria for pattern matching. Finally, the equivalence of these correlation criteria is further validated by numerical simulation and actual experiment.},

abstract = {A universally applicable reliability-guided digital image correlation (DIC) method is proposed for reliable image deformation measurement. The zero-mean normalized cross correlation (ZNCC) coefficient is used to identify the reliability of the point computed. The correlation calculation begins with a seed point and is then guided by the ZNCC coefficient. That means the neighbors of the point with the highest ZNCC coefficient in a queue for computed points will be processed first. Thus the calculation path is always along the most reliable direction, and possible error propagation of the conventional DIC method can be avoided. The proposed novel DIC method is universally applicable to the images with shadows, discontinuous areas, and deformation discontinuity. Two image pairs were used to evaluate the performance of the proposed technique, and the successful results clearly demonstrate its robustness and effectiveness.},

abstract = {The computational efficiency and measurement accuracy of the digital image correlation (DIC) have become more and more important in recent years. For the three-dimensional DIC (3D-DIC), these issues are much more serious. First, there are two cameras employed which increases the computational amount several times. Second, because of the differences in view angles, the must-do stereo correspondence between the left and right images is equivalently a non-uniform deformation, and cannot be weakened by increasing the sampling frequency of digital cameras. This work mainly focuses on the efficiency and accuracy of 3D-DIC. The inverse compositional Gauss–Newton algorithm (IC-GN2) with the second-order shape function is firstly proposed. Because it contains the second-order displacement gradient terms, the measurement accuracy for the non-uniform deformation thus can be improved significantly, which is typically one order higher than the first-order shape function combined with the IC-GN algorithm (IC-GN1), and 2 times faster than the second-order shape function combined with the forward additive Gauss–Newton algorithm (FA-GN2). Then, based on the features of the IC-GN1 and IC-GN2 algorithms, a high-efficiency and high-accuracy measurement strategy for 3D-DIC is proposed in the end.}
