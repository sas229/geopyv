--------

The following tutorials are more advanced and hone in on some of the detailed capabilities of each of the major modules of the `geopyv` package.

.. warning::
    Go through these tutorials only once you have the :ref:`Basic` tutorial under your belt.

These tutorials start with the most basic `geopyv` object: the `Subset`. Next a `Mesh` of subsets are considered, and then a `Sequence` of meshes. A `Particle` can be used to interpolate strains and integrate stresses along a strain path. The `IO` tutorial will show you how to save solved objects and load them back into the Python interpreter for further analysis, and finally the `Plots` tutorial will demonstrate the in-built `Matplotlib` powered plot functionality available in `geopyv`.
